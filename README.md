# Lemma Dilemma

Sparse random projections can be used to reduce the number of dimensions in data sets while keeping the pairwise, euclidean distances between data points.
The Johnson-Lindenstrauss-Lemma computes the theoretical minimum of dimensions for this transformation.
This notebook examines the effect of dimensionality reduction on accuracy and compares distances between data points of original and projected feature space.
